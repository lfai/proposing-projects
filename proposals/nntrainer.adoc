== NNTrainer Project Proposal


=== Name of project

NNTrainer

=== Requested project maturity level

Sandbox.

=== Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history, ongoing development).


NNTrainer is a software framework for training neural network models on embedded devices with limited hardware resources.


Most neural network training frameworks focus on high performance computers (e.g., workstations or clouds), which have relatively huge memory and data, powerful processors, and virtually infinite energy.
NNTrainer provides unique characteristics as a neural network training framework that allows lightweight devices (mobile phones and home appliances) to train and fine-tune neural networks without remote servers.
NNTrainer focuses on saving peak memory consumption, optimizations for lightweight devices, and training scenarios (low-data, real-time, low-computation, or privacy-preserving) for mobile phones and home appliances.




NNTrainer was started as a subproject of NNStreamer, another LFAI project, in Samsung, 2019.
However, common code between NNStreamer and NNTrainer was found to be minimal.
Thus, it was detached from NNStreamer and developed as an independent software package.



From its initial development, NNTrainer has been an open source software project accepting public contributions.
The first "practical" application of NNTrainer was voice personalization (on-device fine-tuned TTS), which was first released with Galaxy S23 in 2023: https://www.zdnet.com/article/this-new-samsung-galaxy-feature-lets-you-clone-your-own-voice-sort-of/[ZDNet: This new Samsung Galaxy feature lets you clone your own voice (sort of)].
Since its first practical application, several practical applications have appeared with even less powerful hardware: e.g., refrigerators, air conditioners, robotic vacuums, and ovens.
Surprisingly, NNTrainer provides on-device training and fine-tuning services for machine learning mechanisms in such home appliacnes with less than 1GB of available memory and a slow embedded CPU core.


In 2024, Galaxy S24 have introduced on-device generative AI services with large language models (LLMs).
NNTrainer has started supporting LLMs and productized LLM applications as well.
Recent contributions in 2025 mostly focus on LLM serving and expanding hardware support; i.e., reduce peak memory consumption, increase throughput, add NPU supports, and add Windows supports.
NNTrainer allows running 30B/20B MoE LLM models on mobile phones with around 1 to 3 GiB of DRAM with reasonable token generation throughput and faster end-to-end latency.

=== Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission.

NNTrainer supports innovation of on-device, resource-efficient, open-source neural network training and personalization under a neutral, vendor-agnostic governance model, and drives interoperable, scalable AI capabilities directly on embedded devices.

=== Have you identified possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects (https://lfai.foundation/projects/)? Please explain. 

* ONNX: ONNX is going to be the standard model format of NNTrainer in the next versions. It is likely that NNTrainer is going to be fully compatible with ONNX within a few months. It is highly desirable if NNTrainer's quantization formats and LLM context and weight save/load can be upstreamed to ONNX standard format.
* NNStreamer: NNTrainer provides plugins for NNStreamer and its other spun-off projects (Device MLOps and ML API). Many consumer electronics products access nntrainer via NNStreamer and its APIs.
