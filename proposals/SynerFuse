== SynerFuse Project Proposal


* Name of project: SynerFuse

* Requested project maturity level: Sandbox

* Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history, ongoing development):

This open source project is trying to build an open AI framework to enable the distributed training in between heterogeneous accelators.
AI infrastructure may contain different types or generations of accelerator systems. One of the key challenges is to uniform these heterogenous accelerators into a resource pool and improve the utilization rate. 
Large scale model training normally requires a massive amount of computing resources. It's important and valuable to have an open AI framework that enable training or inferencing task crossing multi-architecture accelerators.  
This project is initialized by China Mobile Research Institute, and currently the main developers are from China Mobile.
A draft version of this AI framework with basic functions has been implemented. It has been verified with LLaMA2 7B & 13B models with several types of GPUs devices. 

* Statement on alignment with LF AI’s mission: 
The mission of LF AI & Data is to build and support an open artificial intelligence (AI) and data community, and drive open source innovation in the AI and data domains by enabling collaboration and the creation of new opportunities for all the members of the community.

* Have you identified possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects (https://lfai.foundation/projects/)? ：
1.COIA: collaborate with COIA and relative projects, understanding the needs during the project promotion and implementation, and enhance the project collabration.
2.OPEA: collaborate with OPEA project to be one of the training framework components. 
3.Horovod: collaborate with horovod to support TensorFlow framework.
4.Elastic Deep Learning: monitor performance of training tasks in real time and flexibly adjust resources while tasks are running.
