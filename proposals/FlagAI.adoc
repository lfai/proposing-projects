== FlagAI Project Proposal

*Name of project*: FlagAI

*Requested project maturity level*: Sandbox

=== Project description

FlagAI (Fast LArge-scale General AI models) is an fast, easy-to-use and extensible toolkit for large-scale model. Our goal is to support training, fine-tuning, and deployment of large-scale models on various downstream tasks with multi-modality. Currently, we are focusing on NLP models and tasks. In near futher, we will support for other modalities.

* Now it supports GLM, BERT, RoBERTa, GPT2, T5, and models from Huggingface Transformers.
* It provides APIs to quickly download and use those pre-trained models on a given text, and fine-tune them on your own datasets.
* These models can be applied to (chinese/english) Text, for tasks like text classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, and text generation. 
* FlagAI is backed by the three most popular data/model parallel libraries — PyTorch/Deepspeed/Megatron-LM — with seamless integration between them. Your can parallel your training/testing process with less than ten lines of code.

=== Statement on alignment with LF AI’s mission

Transformer-based large-scale model is a keypath to *build general AI*. It becomes the most powerful and famous technique lately.

The transformer-based model can *understand natural language, category images and play video games as human beings*:

* Provide off-the-shelf tools for researchers/engineers to train/infer large-scale models, e.g., data-/model- parallel training algorithms. 
* Build-in supports for most used model structures, e.g., encoder, decoder, and enc-dec structure. Users can even download a 10-billion parameters model and run it on a single GPU (V100).
* Build-in supports for many popular downstream tasks. Users can directly pull the finetuned model and run the model with a few lines of code.

FlagAI project will also:

* Easy to use: unified and simplified APIs to build and train models.
* Easy to scale: one can run a 10-b model with a few lines of code.



=== Possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects


FlagAI provides full technical support for the life-circle of large-scale AI model, especially *inference* and *deploy*:
