### Name of project

https://iree.dev[IREE]

### Requested project maturity level

Sandbox

### Project description (what it does, why it is valuable, origin and history, ongoing development).

IREE (Intermediate Representation Execution Environment) is an MLIR-based
end-to-end compiler and runtime that lowers Machine Learning (ML) models to a
unified IR that scales up to meet the needs of the datacenter and down to
satisfy the constraints and special considerations of mobile and edge
deployments. The mission is to provide a toolkit for ML model deployment that
is able to exploit heterogeneous compute environments and provide a consistent
authoring flow to deploy across multiple platforms easily embracing new
hardware or specialization.

IREE started OSS-first development in 2019 driven by team at Google focussing
on deployment of ML models on mobile. Since then IREE (and components built by
IREE team) has developed an OSS community with contributions and users from
multiple companies, grown to use over multiple plaforms spanning from embedded
to distributed server deployment, from ML to usage inside game engines.

### Statement on alignment with LF AIâ€™s mission.

As a group of engineers who have worked in AI, compilers and runtimes broadly
for many years, we identify with the practical approach that LF AI&D takes by
aiming to provide "a greenhouse" for concrete innovations, rooted in good
open-source principles and execution. As the core contributors have worked for
various entities over the years and integrated the technology into multiple
product roadmaps, we've always taken pride in making the low level
infrastructure investment an evergreen community project that can underlie many
things as time and situations evolve. In this day and age, however, it takes
more than a commitment to the low level engineering, and we appreciate the
opportunity to align with LF AI&D so that we can together add the structure to
the project itself so that it remains a viable, approachable and community
grounded initiative.

### Have you identified possible collaboration opportunities with current LF AI hosted projects (https://lfai.foundation/projects/)? Please explain.

Not extensively. The IREE project already consumes ONNX programs but this is
more a user relationship. Superficial evaluation would indicate potential
opporutnies related to Ludwig, 1chipML, CLAIMED, Delta, RKWV and ShaderNN.
